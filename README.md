## Competitions

### Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
**Type:** Binary Classification  
**Location:** `titanic/`

Binary classification to predict passenger survival. Implemented comprehensive feature engineering including family relationships, interaction terms, and saturated logistic models. Used L1 regularization for feature selection and compared multiple algorithms.

**Results:**
- Cross-validation: 82.5% accuracy
- Best approach: 4-feature model (Sex_Male, Age_Child, CabinCount, LargeFamily)

### House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques  
**Type:** Regression  
**Location:** `house-prices/`

Predict house sale prices using 79 features. Extensive analysis included correlation studies, feature engineering, transformation testing, and hyperparameter optimization. Implemented proper cross-validation methodology to prevent data leakage.

**Results:**
- Leaderboard score: 0.12241 RMSE
- Best approach: CatBoost + Box-Cox transformation + 116 engineered features
- Key finding: Box-Cox (Î»=-0.077) outperformed standard log transformation

### Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting
